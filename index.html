  <h2 class="post-title">Objectives</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">HermitCore is a novel <a href="http://unikernel.org">unikernel</a> operating system targeting a scalable and predictable runtime behavior for HPC and cloud environments. The current version supports C/C++, Fortran, Go, Pthreads, OpenMP and <a href="http://www.lfbs.rwth-aachen.de/publications/files/iRCCE.pdf">iRCCE</a> as message passing library. The potential of HermitCore is illustrated by a small number of <a href="search/index.html#video">videos</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Design</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">HermitCore can be used as classical unikernel within a virtual machine. In addition, it extends the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2931088.2931092">multi-kernel approach</a> (like FusedOS, McKernel and mOS) and combines it with unikernel features.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Platform</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">HermitCore is designed for KVM/Linux but also for x86_64 bare-metal environments and provides a better programmability and scalability for hierarchical systems, which based on multiple cluster-on-a-chip processors.</p>
