Together with the colleagues from [Systems Software Research Group at Virginia Tech](https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/), we develop the unikernel [HermiTux](https://ssrg-vt.github.io/hermitux/), which is binary compatible to Linux and able to run native Linux executables.
For a detailed description please read the [Hermitux paper](https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee2019.pdf), which was presented at [15th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments](https://conf.researchr.org/home/vee-2019) (VEE'19) and won the best paper award.
